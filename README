pkb4unix - A personal knowledge base using RDF and SPARQL
           following the UNIX philosophy

For more information see

    http://www.andonyar.com/rec/2012/pkb/

=== Requirements ===

- Python 3
- A recent version of RDFLib <https://github.com/RDFLib>
- A SPARQL endpoint
- A Unix-like operating system (tested on Linux only)

=== Setup ===

First open the file "know" and change at the top the value of the
variable KNOW_PATH to the directory where the files know-* reside:

    KNOW_PATH = "/path/to/know/executables"

Also, you will need a SPARQL endpoint. You can use any SPARQL server
that supports SPARQL 1.1 Query, Update, and the HTTP Graph Store
protocol. pkb4unix is tested with Sesame <http://www.openrdf.org/>.

=== Environment Variables ===

The scripts know-* need a few environment variables to be set.
You are advised to run the scripts through the wapper `know`. It will
set the environment variables to their defaults if not already
present.

=== Usage ===

Find out what commands are available:

    know help

Read the help of a command:

    know <command> --help
