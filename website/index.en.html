<h1>A Personal Knowledge Base</h1>

<h2>What this is all about and Motivation</h2>

<p>The following things happened several times to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I rember having read something on some website but can't find it
anymore. This is especially embarassing when a friend is watching and
Google just does not want to return the right result.</li>
<li>I visit a website and consider it worthy to visit again later. But
where should I put a note so I find it again later?</li>
<li>For a thesis I have to work with several papers. Of course, I store the
metadata as BiBTeX. Such papers often come in handy in other
situations, therefore it would be useful to manage the metadata
centrally and searchable.</li>
<li>I discover some piece of software for a certain task. Next time I
need to perform a similar task, I want to remember what software I
chose.</li>
<li>I find a solution for some problem which turns up seldomly. I want
to be able to look up this solution whenever I encounter a similar
problem. Or stated the other way: Given a problem, I want to be able
to look up whether I already solved it in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p>These events all sound like they should be solvable with currently
available software. Maybe so, but I am the kind of person who
wants to build his own tailored solution.</p>
<p>Let us look at the
requirements: The data I want to store is
manifold. I have problems, solutions, tasks, websites, papers and
topics. Furthermore, I will likely be tempted to introduce more and
more properties for all of them. Take papers as an example. There are
many BiBTeX properties: authors, publisher, date, journal (issue, page
and so on), title, URL, DOI. The list is virtually open ended. Also
one is tempted to add more properties, for example one which says in
which way the paper has been useful in the past. The things I
want to add to my knowledge base should have relations between each
other: A paper is related to a topic and an author. An author is
related to her email address and her university. A solution is related
to the problem it solves. I want to be able to build the knowledge
base gradually and introduce new concepts and properties when
needed.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is very difficult to do all this using relational
databases. Sematic Web enthusiasts already know what the right thing
is in this case. I will build upon Semantic Web standards and plug
together readily available software. Also, I hope to benefit from
integration with the Semantic Web, for example, metadata about 
papers is provided by many publishers in RDF, so I don't need to enter
that data myself.</p>
<p>This page is organized as a blog. I will report here from time to
time how my knowledge base evolves. Everything mentioned above will be
fleshed out and I will show how it works in practise.</p>

<h2>Following the UNIX Philosophy</h2>

<p>The requirements for my knowledge base are not very clear yet. In
fact, I have to explicitely allow them to change over time. Because of
this, it is important to stick to the UNIX philosophy. Among its
principles are <q>Separate mechanism from policy</q>, <q>Write simple
parts connected by clean interfaces</q>, <q>Fold knowledge into data,
so program logic can be stupid and robust</q>, and <q>Prototype before
polishing</q>. I will addhere to these principles like this:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Separate mechanism from policy</dt>
<dd>I am going to use a SPAQRL endpoint to store and query the RDF
data. Several libraries to handle RDF data and to create presentation
from it are already available or will be developed by myself. This all
implements the mechanism. The policy will be determined by the small
tools I am going to write and how they will be configured.</dd>
<dt>Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces</dt>
<dd>My toolkit is going to be split up into the SPARQL endpoint and
several small tools interacting with the SPARQL endpoint, acting as
filters, or providing a GUI.</dd>
<dt>Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust</dt>
<dd>In fact, a SPARQL endpoint is as stupid as it can get. It
basically stores quadruples of meaningless identifiers and is able to
query them equaly meaninglessly. Indeed, it has no knowledge what
these identifiers mean. With a little luck, a SPARQL knows the 
meaning of identifiers in the RDFS or OWL namespace and is able to do
reasoning. Also, I will use a a library which presents RDF
data in a human-digestable way. How these presentations look like will
also be described in RDF. So, program logic will really be stupid.</dd>
<dt>Prototype before polishing</dt>
<dd>I am going to use Python, which is an excellent language for
prototyping. Efficiency will not be a concern for the beginning, since
this is a <em>personal</em> knowledge base which will likely not need
to handle a huge flood of data.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>A SPARQL Endpoint</h2>

<p>This time, I'll install a SPARQL edpoint. I decided myself for
<a href="http://www.openrdf.org/">Sesame 2.7.0-beta2</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame2/users/ch06.html#section-sesame-server-installation">
Installation Instructions</a> can be found in Sesame's documentation.
Sesame is a Java application and needs a Servelt container in order
to be run as a SPARQL endpoint. I'll use Tomcat from my Debian
distribution found in the package <code>tomcat7-user</code>. This
package is special in that it allows a user to easily setup and run
Tomcat on his machine for testing purposes. Setting up a
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">tomcat</a> instance is very
easy:</p>

<pre>
urs@speedy:~/p/knowledge$ tomcat7-instance-create --help
Usage: tomcat7-instance-create [options] &lt;directoryname&gt;
  directoryname: name of the tomcat instance directory to create
Options:
  -h, --help       Display this help message
  -p httpport      HTTP port to be used by Tomcat (default is 8080)
  -c controlport   Server shutdown control port (default is 8005)
  -w magicword     Word to send to trigger shutdown (default is SHUTDOWN)
urs@speedy:~/p/knowledge$ tomcat7-instance-create tomcat-instance
You are about to create a Tomcat instance in directory 'tomcat-instance'
nc: unable to connect to address localhost, service 8080
nc: unable to connect to address localhost, service 8005
* New Tomcat instance created in tomcat-instance
* You might want to edit default configuration in tomcat-instance/conf
* Run tomcat-instance/bin/startup.sh to start your Tomcat instance
</pre>

<p>Unpacking Sesame reveals two war files, one for the Sesame itself
and one for the Sesame Workbench. These must be dropped into Tomcat's
<code>webapps</code> directory.</p>

<pre>
urs@speedy:~/p/knowledge$ cd sesame/
urs@speedy:~/p/knowledge/sesame$ tar -xzf openrdf-sesame-2.7.0-beta2-sdk.tar.gz
urs@speedy:~/p/knowledge/sesame$ ls openrdf-sesame-2.7.0-beta2/war/
openrdf-sesame.war  openrdf-workbench.war
urs@speedy:~/p/knowledge/sesame$ cd ..
urs@speedy:~/p/knowledge$ cp sesame/openrdf-sesame-2.7.0-beta2/war/* tomcat-instance/webapps/
</pre>

<p>This does the trick. Starting and stopping tomcat is easy with 
<code>./tomcat-instance/bin/startup.sh</code> and
<code>./tomcat-instance/bin/shutdown.sh</code>.
Note that Sesame's data is stored in <code>~/.aduna/</code>.
After starting,
Sesame's Workbench can be accessed via
<a href="http://localhost:8080/openrdf-workbench/">http://localhost:8080/openrdf-workbench/</a>
and the server is at
<a href="http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame">http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame</a>.
Using the workbench, one can create new repositories. For my Personal
Knowledge Base I create one of type <code>Native Java Store RDF
Schema</code> with ID <code>pkb</code> and title <code>Personal
Knowledge Base</code>.</p>

<p>Using the workbench, one can load and query graphs easily. It is
useful when doing simple things, but for complex things, I will have
to write my own tools.</p>
